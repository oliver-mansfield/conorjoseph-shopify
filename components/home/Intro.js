					Second Skin is the latest collection by Conor Joseph, which sees the
					Jewellery artist pay homage to the human body and its varying
					differences and uniqueness.
				</p>
				<p>
					The collection is made of 30 pieces, all made on fine gold plated
					silver, hand crafted in London’s prestigious Hatton Garden. Like most
					of Conor’s work, Second Skin is a dark and obscure collection, yet his
					use of often-uncelebrated details of the skin such as wrinkles,
					freckles and scarring creates provokes feelings of intimacy and
					poeticism.
